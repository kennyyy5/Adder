Program Specification:
The Adder game prompts a player for the answer to an addition problem. The Adder game creates a problem from two randomly selected integers between 0 and 20. Adder allows the player
three tries to enter a correct answer. If the correct answer is entered on the first try, the player is
awarded 5 points. If the correct answer is entered on the second try, 3 points are awarded. The
correct answer on the third try earns 1 point. If after three tries, the correct answer is still not
entered, the player receives no points and the correct answer is displayed. The game continues until
999 is entered as an answer. At the end of the game, Adder displays the playerâ€™s score.
